# Mocha with ES6 in browser

This is a simplistic project illustrating how to run tests with Mocha and Chai in the browser.

This is a variation of [Mocha with Rollup and ES6](https://github.com/minimum-code-samples/mocha-rollup-es6) with the tests running in the browser.

## TL;DR

Use this template to create Mocha-Chai tests that run in the browser.

## Description

This project serves as a template as it does a reference for creating Mocha tests and running them in the browser.

The test page is "tests/index.html" and loads the test file "tests/test.js".

Since the test file already imports the source file, there is no need to include the source file in the browser.

This variation also demonstrates the use of the `default` keyword in the module.
